description: A blender project that worked with creating clothing for an existing character model. The focus of this project was the creation of realistic cloth in both procedural texturing and physics simulations.

heading2: Texturing and Physics
description2: Here, I challanged myself to create a fabric texture using only procedural nodes. I learned a lot about the capabilities of this texturing style, but the physics were a lot more challenging. Unfortunately, a while after fiddling with the skeleton it occurred to me that it was the contact points on the model that were messing up the cloth physics. After getting a generic model and having the cloak interact with that instead, it worked like a charm!
heading3: Crown and Lighting
description3: While the model of the crown was relitively simple, I wanted to make up for it by creating an interesting texture that could show a lot of detail and act as a strong visual centerpiece. I attempted to take a more alternitive route for the lighting to enhance the focal point even more.
