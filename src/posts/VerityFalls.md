description: Verity Falls is a small game developed by me and 2 other classmates. It is a mystery / detective game with PSX inspired graphics. For the game, I developed 10 unique characters and a few static objects for players to control, engage, and interact with.

heading2: Character Development
description2: At the start, we had descriptions of characters and needed visualization to help move the narrative around as appearance matters in the story. I started with sketches of the characters. Adding more detail to the sketches made creating simplified 3D graphics easier. As we wanted an older style of graphics in our art direction, the sketches eventually became simpler in order to streamline the process of creating the characters as more time could be spent on modeling, UV painting and rigging.
heading3: Modeling
description3: With the chosen art direction, and considering the amount of characters that were needed to fit the narritive of the game, I went for an older, more stylized approach to the characters and their bodies topology. As is the same with older games, details were left to the texturing process rather than the modeling one.
