description: This is a redesign of the Project Gutenberg site. This was an exercise in creating cohesive art direction and considering what could be improved in an existing design system. Through research and careful consideration, this redesign was born!
layout: workPageNoVid.njk
heading2: Reasoning and Process
description2: Having a more specific audience, Project Gutenberg has created a working site that lacks the feel of a digital reading space. Considering existing site navigation, logos, imagery, colours, audience, and content I developed an art direction and made a few design samples. Through iteration, I found a style that I felt suited the site, making it more appealing and pleasurable to engage or interact with.
heading3: Workflow
description3: With the new goals and page planning for the site completed, I began creating block outs for different page layouts. After this I created custom icons, created a few design samples, then began the entire redesign with all the new assets.
