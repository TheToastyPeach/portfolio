        <h1>Mysterious Character</h1>
        <p>
          This project was an exercise in developing 3D character assets along with simulating the use of assets from a team. This meant while the environmental design was completed entirely by me, the models for the environments were sourced from other artists on the internet. The character, however, was created entirely by me, including rigging!

        <h2>Character Look Development</h2>
        <p>
          I felt a struck a nice balance between complexity and simplicity, with enough elements to make an interesting silhouette, but few enough to fit the style of the animation. I started with a sketch, and moved to 3d, and I can say that this workflow sped the entire process up a lot compared to starting from scratch. Even a simple outline of the staff made the creation process faster and more enjoyable.

        <h2>Rigging</h2>
        <p>
          As I had planned the movements ahead of time, I knew the rig I needed only needed to support some more general and simple movements. This helped create a better working rig as more time could go into the weight paint part of the process.
