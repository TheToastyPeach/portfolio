          A continuation of the Mysterious Character project. This final animation was an exercise in simulating a real working environment, pulling assets from different artists to create a single narrative. All content is sourced in the description of the animation video! The environmental design was made possible from these artists.

        <h2>Look Development</h2>
        <p>
          I created all my own shaders for the objects. I felt this tied the whole animation together and created a coherent vibe / environment for the story. As models were sourced from various artists, it was necessary for a consistent sense of art direction. On top of this, I was happy with the outline effect on the character. Even though it&#39;s not technically a shader, I felt it balanced the scene and put emphasis on the different focal points throughout the short film.

        <h2>Enviroment Building</h2>
        <p>
          Sourcing the models from different artists also allowed me to focus more on the intent and atmosphere of the enviroment as a whole. This was my first experience working from this pipeline, and I can say I was very happy with the turn out of the environments. I wanted to build interest and depth within the world without overwhelming the viewer.
