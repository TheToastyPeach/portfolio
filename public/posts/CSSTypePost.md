description: This site was a test to see how far only CSS and HTML could take me in layout options. I chose to set my sights on a classic form of design- the typographic poster.
layout: workPageSmall.njk
heading2: Why Type?
description2: Home to static compositions yet playful layouts, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to challenge myself. Unfortunately, only some browsers support the many new features showcased in the site, so make sure to cross check with the provided screen shots! The "drama" behind the Baskerville font played into the idea that elements of the page would be animated, as making readable content move is a little taboo. I saw the perfect opportunity to show of different sizes of the type without having to type out explicitly different weights and sizes. I also attempted to simulate some of the letters interacting with each other as they would so often do in typographic posters!
