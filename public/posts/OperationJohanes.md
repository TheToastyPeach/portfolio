description: This chrome-based extension works to change the design of the University of Lethbridge’s “Bridge” site. This site is a place for students to register to classes, view schedules, and pay fees. Even though it's frequented by many, its current design needed work.
layout: workPageSmall.njk
heading2: Reasoning and Process
description2: Unfortunately, changing the design of the site meant working through the old one. This site was constructed entirely from tables, meaning that it was not only plain, but also ignored accessibility for technology such as screen readers. Through JS, I targeted specific elements and clean up the HTML while implementing a chunked style, allowing for easier navigation and reading. It can also be toggled on and off though the extension icon.
