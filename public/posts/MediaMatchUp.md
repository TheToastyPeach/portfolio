description: Media Match-Up is a site that makes use of APIs to find films and compare different aspects of them. As this was once again an exercise in learning a new web system, the UI is minimal, but the functionality is advanced.

description2: With the creation of this site, I wanted to use JS to manipulate the DOM and change page content without navigating to a different page or microsite. On top of this, data is pulled from an external site though an API, then targeted depending on the type of data, and compared to measure what film has higher or lower revenue or reviews.
