description: Blissful Balance works as a tool to manage time and as a reminder of how long you've been in different spaces online. Using the JS library Anime.JS I created a mindfully soft site, making use of calmer colours, shapes, and fonts to allow the feeling of bliss.

description2: Using this library took away a lot of the strange concepts that come with css animations. Although it achieves similar results at surface level, it provides the user with a lot more freedom with the animation and the values that correspond with said animations. Finding a style of animation to match the art direction of the site was a goal of the site, creating a cohesive and minimal feel to the space.
