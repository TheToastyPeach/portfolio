description: I've modelled a lot of environment set pieces recently but I haven't been working on the more natural parts as much as I'd like to. I took this as an opportunity to start learning new software and workflows to expand my skill sets.

heading2: Sculpting and Painting
description2: Although there was a learning curve for modeling in Maya, I found that some of the tools that Blender didn't have worked better towards what I wanted to achieve with this landscape. I have found more control over UV unwrapping in Maya than I have in Blender, showing the strengths of knowing both programs. On top of this, I found that the painting process in Substance Painter was much easier, as I was able to use layers to separate and stack different textures and colours on top of each other to make a more realistic and interesting textures for the model. 
heading3: Game Engine Context 
description3: Currently, I am adding all of these assets into a game engine, I thought I'd use it as an opportunity to practice my hard surface skills. I've created an interesting farmers tool I found online and am currently working on creating a weapon to be held by the camera man. -The colours are to mark material differences for later in the process.
