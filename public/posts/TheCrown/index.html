        <h1>The Crown</h1>
        <p>
          A blender project that worked with creating clothing for an existing character model. The focus of this project was the creation of realistic cloth in both procedural texturing and physics simulations.

        <h2>Texturing and Physics</h2>
        <p>
          Here, I challanged myself to create a fabric texture using only procedural nodes. I learned a lot about the capabilities of this texturing style, but the physics were a lot more challenging. Unfortunately, a while after fiddling with the skeleton it occurred to me that it was the contact points on the model that were messing up the cloth physics. After getting a generic model and having the cloak interact with that instead, it worked like a charm!

        <h2>Crown and Lighting</h2>
        <p>
          While the model of the crown was relitively simple, I wanted to make up for it by creating an interesting texture that could show a lot of detail and act as a strong visual centerpiece. I attempted to take a more alternitive route for the lighting to enhance the focal point even more.
